# Algorithms and Data Structures – Custom Implementations in C#

**Module Grade: 79% – First Class Honours**

This project showcases custom implementations of common data structures and sorting/searching algorithms using **C#**, created as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures module during my first year at university.

The key challenge was to write all functionality **from scratch** without using .NET’s built-in collections or sorting libraries. This forced a deeper understanding of how data is stored, accessed, sorted, and traversed under the hood.

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Reinforce core algorithmic logic and structure
- Build practical understanding of data structure behavior
- Improve debugging and test-driven development skills
- Translate theoretical concepts into functioning C# code

## 🧰 Implemented Structures & Algorithms

### 🗃 Data Structures
- ✅ Stack (Push/Pop)
- ✅ Queue (Enqueue/Dequeue)
- ✅ Singly Linked List (Add, Insert, Remove, Move)
- ✅ Doubly Linked List (Full operations set)
- ✅ Binary Search Tree (Add/Search)
- ✅ Binary Min Heap

### 🧮 Sorting Algorithms
- ✅ Bubble Sort
- ✅ Insertion Sort
- ✅ Quick Sort
- ✅ Radix Sort

### 📍 Pathfinding / Advanced
- ✅ Binary Search
- ✅ Travelling Salesman (Nearest Neighbour Algorithm)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `AlgorithumsAndDataStructures/` – Main C# implementation project
- `Test/` – xUnit-based testing suite for all structures and algorithms
- `Sorts.cs`, `Stack.cs`, `Queue.cs`, `TravellingSalesMan.cs`, etc. – Each structure/algorithm in its own file for clarity

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Environment:** Visual Studio
- **Framework:** .NET Core / .NET 5
- **Testing:** xUnit

---

## ✅ Highlights

- All algorithms built **from the ground up**
- Each component tested with edge cases in a separate test project
- Logically separated, readable code with functional class design
- Demonstrated grasp of **time complexity** and structural trade-offs

## 💭 Reflection

This module allowed me to go beyond basic syntax and start thinking algorithmically. It gave me confidence when approaching systems-level programming later on, and I still reference some of the techniques today.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

I’m proud of the clarity and organization in this project. It marks the point where I transitioned from being a beginner in C# to someone who could build and test low-level systems by hand.
