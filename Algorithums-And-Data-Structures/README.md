# **Overall grade for Module: 79% ** 
Algorithums And Data Structures:

For this assessment, you will submit the following algorithms and data structures as part of a single
C# project. I Expect to see a single program that demonstrated the algorithms and data structures,
listed below.  
Please use the default project provided on bright space. 
You are expected to implement these algorithms and data structures on your own. Do not use the
inbuilt algorithms and data structures.  
If you use a resource to help you, you MUST reference it!  
If you submit just the code files with no project, I will not rebuild the project for you.  
If you submit more than one project, I will run the first one and no other.  

Algorithms and data structures to implement:

Stack  
Enqueue push  
Dequeue pop  

Queue  
Enqueue  
Dequeue  

Linked List  
add
