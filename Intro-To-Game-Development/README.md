Introduction to Game Devlopment:

**Brief for Module:**  
Working individually, you will create a 2D game in either Unity or Unreal Engine 4. The game will be feature either a top-down or side on camera.   
Once you have selected your perspective, consider how other games with that perspective play, what mechanics do they feature? Which mechanics might you want in your game? Remember to keep them simple!  
Your game will have at least one playable level or area, a main menu that provides play and quit buttons and sound effects or animations.  
Most of the gameplay logic must be implemented yourself, if you do find help online with a mechanic or to help solve a problem, you must reference where it came from. Similarly, any art assets, sound effects or other assets that you import to the game that you do not make must be referenced correctly too.
