# Introduction to Game Development – 2D Game Project (Unity)

**Module Grade: 47% – Pass**

This was my first hands-on game development module, where I was tasked with designing and building a **2D game** in Unity (or Unreal). The project required implementing core gameplay features independently, alongside a playable level and a basic UI system.

Although I encountered technical and workflow challenges that impacted the final grade, this module introduced me to real-world game engine work and laid the groundwork for later success in Unity, C#, and gameplay systems.

## 🎮 Project Brief

Create a **2D game** with:
- Either a **top-down** or **side-on** camera
- A fully playable level/area
- A **main menu** with Play and Quit options
- Sound effects or simple animations
- Self-authored gameplay logic (with cited support if needed)
- Documentation of any third-party assets/tutorials used

---

## 📁 Submission Included

- 🎮 Unity project files
- 🎨 Source art and audio (where applicable)
- 📝 A written bibliography of referenced materials
- 🧠 First steps into structured gameplay design

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Scene setup and camera handling in Unity
- UI creation (buttons, basic menus)
- Trigger-based events and player control
- Understanding Unity’s object/component workflow
- Working through frustration and technical barriers

## 💭 Reflection

Despite the low grade, this project was a pivotal learning moment. I started to understand:
- What makes a game feel functional
- How to bring ideas into a playable format
- The challenges of learning a game engine for the first time

This module served as a **baseline for future Unity projects**, including tools, systems, and full-scale prototypes developed in later years.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

It wasn’t my strongest performance, but I showed up, submitted a complete game, and learned the hard way how to build upon setbacks. I now view this module as the foundation that sparked my growth as a game developer.
