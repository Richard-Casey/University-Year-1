Task: "One of the games mentioned in “Dicing with Destiny” is the so-called “Stanway Game”.  
Using the UoS Discovery search tool and the UoS library catalogue, compile a short  
bibliography of about 3–5 items (full-length books, contributions to edited collections,  
journal articles) that would be relevant and useful to somebody who wanted to find out  
more about The Stanway Game.  
Your bibliography should include at least one full-length book, at least one contribution to  
an edited collection or “reader”, and at least one full-length book.  
Present your bibliography in the form of a Harvard-style bibliography (or “reference list”)  
arranged in alphabetical order of author-surname.  
Present your results in the form of a Harvard-style bibliography of no more than five items  
and upload the file(s) to your ePortfolio (My Brightspace > ePortfolio). You may need to  
adjust your ePortfolio’s sharing options to make your bibliography visible to others"
