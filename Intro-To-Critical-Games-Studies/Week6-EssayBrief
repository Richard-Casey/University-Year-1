Assignment Brief: Game Analysis Essay

Select one of the early modern or ancient games you have studied on the module and, drawing on appropriate sources, provide
some brief historical context for your chosen game (where it is from and how it is played, along with any other relevant information
about its cultural meaning and/or how it may have evolved) together with a brief description of the game and game mechanics,
drawing on appropriate terminology. Comment on your experience of playing the game (how long is a game? What is the object of
the game? Are there any particular tactics or other aspects of gameplay that make the game enjoyable or fun to play?) Finally,
comment on whether you think the game would be enjoyed today: if so, why? If not, briefly discuss which aspect(s) of the game
would have to be changed, and how, in order to make the game appeal to a contemporary audience or audience segment. Support
your discussion of game mechanics and design elements with close reference to suitable sources concerned with game design.
