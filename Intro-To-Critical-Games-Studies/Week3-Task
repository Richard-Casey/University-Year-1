1. What does LeBlanc mean when he says ‘we cannot create drama’ (LeBlanc 2006, p. 440)?  
2. What is the word LeBlanc uses to describe the rules, the pieces and any other necessary elements
that are required to play a game?  
3. LeBlanc uses the term “dynamics” to describe the way in which a game “behaves” or responds
when the various game elements are activated by players. What, according to LeBlanc, is the
relation between a game’s dynamics and its mechanics?  
4. According to LeBlanc’s framework, the things that players do with or get from a game, beyond
creating an interplay of dynamics and mechanics, is defined by the term “aesthetics”. Give an
example of “aesthetics” from your own game play experience, referring to the last non-digital gameyou
played by way of example.  
5. Review the material on pp. 442–446. Use the concept of “dramatic tension”, along with one or two
other terms/concepts from the article that you deem relevant, to describe the current state of the
game pf Noughts and Crosses shown below. “Crosses” started and has had two moves; “Noughts” has
had one move and is about to play:
