Critical Games Studies:

This module introduces students to some selected historical and cultural aspects of games in order to provide
a broader background to the topic of the changing role and function of games in culture and society over
time.   Through a series of case studies looking at historical examples of ancient games and Early Modern
games, the module will explore some of the ways in which games historians and ludologists have defined and
categorised games.  A range of study skills are integrated into the module to ensure that students are
introduced to essential scholarly conventions appropriate to this level of undergraduate study.
