# Group Project (Year 1) – Sling! (Unity Game)

**Overall Game Grade: 53% – Pass**  
**Individual Contributions Grade: 66% – Upper Second Class (2:1)**

This was my first major group project at university. We were tasked with producing a playable game prototype as a team over a semester. Our game was titled **"Sling!"**, a quirky 3D platformer starring a spider navigating a hazardous kitchen environment using slingshot-style movement mechanics.

## 🎮 Game Overview – Sling!

**Sling!** is a third-person physics-based traversal game where the player controls a spider that swings across countertops, dodges kitchen hazards, and tries to reach the finish point.

- Physics-based **web slinging and climbing**
- Environmental hazards (fire, boiling water, slippery surfaces)
- Custom movement, jump, and climb scripts
- Raycasting for detection and interaction
- Health system and basic UI elements

- **Grade Earned: 53%**

### 🧾 Assignment 2 – Individual Portfolio (80%)
- Screenshots of contributions (scripts, problem solving, communication)
- Custom C# scripting across player control, UI, and systems
- Group conflict documentation and leadership reflection
- **Grade Earned: 66%**

## 📁 Project Contents

- `Game-Submission/` – The Unity project build of *Sling!*
- `Individual-Contributions/` – Scripts, screenshots, and postmortem documentation
- `Scripts/` – All authored C# gameplay scripts
- `ScreenShots/` – Evidence of collaboration, problem solving, and build testing

## 💭 Reflection

This was my first experience with collaborative development, and it taught me as much about **team management** as it did about scripting. We faced challenges around participation, communication, and creative vision — but I still delivered substantial, documented code and design work.

It also helped me learn:
- How to work independently within a team
- The value of clear documentation and testing
- How to handle technical and interpersonal roadblocks

---

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

*Sling!* was far from perfect — but it was the project where I proved I could contribute meaningfully, communicate professionally, and write functional gameplay code. It laid a foundation for later solo and team-based projects in Year 2 and beyond.
