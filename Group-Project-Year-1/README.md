Group Project:

Managing Games Production / Group Project  
Assignment 1: The game (20%)  
In this assignment, we are assessing the skills you have developed so far in the following areas:
Produce a game within identifiable constraints through an iterative approach to game
production.  
This assignment will demonstrate your ability to complete a game against an initial design
specification. Quality of gameplay experience, iterative development of the game and ability to
satisfy an identified market through appropriate gameplay design will be examined. The game will
be completed as a group, and therefore group marks will be given to each student. For example, if a
game is considered passable at 65%, all students who made that game, and provided evidence of
individual contributions, will receive 65% for this assessment.  
You have been tasked with developing a game within a team across the whole semester.  

Managing Games Production / Group Project  
Assignment 2: Individual portfolio of contributions to the Semester 2 game (80%)
In this assignment, we are assessing the skills you have developed so far in the following areas:  
Produce a game within identifiable constraints through an iterative approach to game
production.  
Plan, estimate and control the resource requirements for small projects on an ongoing basis.  
Demonstrate intermediate level knowledge in the use of appropriate project management
software to devise quality management systems for small projects.  
Proactively maintain communication and reflect on a gameâ€™s development within a small
development team.  

Throughout this semester, you will be participating in the game development process through a
semester long game development project. This will show your ability to estimate and control project
resources, implement and execute test plans on an ongoing basis, communicate game and individual
progress in a consistent and effective manner, including the ability to pitch. Use of documentation
and software related to project management will also be demonstrated in addition to your ability to
reflect on work and identify best practices on a range of issues
