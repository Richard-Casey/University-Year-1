# Introduction to Programming – C# Foundations

**Module Grade: 77.2% – First Class Honours**

This was my first formal programming module at university, focusing on foundational coding principles using **C#**. The content covered essential programming concepts through structured weekly progress checks — which served both as tutorials and self-assessment.

---

## 🧠 Module Focus

- Understand basic **programming logic and control flow**
- Develop competency using **Visual Studio** and **C#**
- Use structured programming techniques (conditions, loops, functions)
- Write clean, readable code with consistent formatting
- Engage with regular **progress checks** to reinforce learning

---

## 📁 Folder Contents

This folder contains:
- 🔍 Code I wrote during the module’s progress checks
- 🧾 Exported results and screenshots where applicable
- 📘 Reference material provided to us during the course

Due to how the quizzes worked, questions were not viewable after submission, so I’ve included only the material and my responses.

---

## 🔧 Key Topics Covered

- Variables, types, and user input
- Conditional statements (if/else/switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Methods and parameters
- Arrays and simple data structures

## 💭 Reflection

This module played a huge role in shaping my understanding of programming. I returned to the content often throughout my first and even second year as a **reliable reference point** when tackling new concepts or debugging issues.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

Clear, consistent practice and solid teaching made this one of the most important early modules of my degree. It built the confidence and structure I’d need to approach more complex subjects like engine development and tools programming later on.
