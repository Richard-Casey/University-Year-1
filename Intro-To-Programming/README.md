#**Overall Grade for Module: 77.2%**

This module was very informative and provided a lot of information.

The tasks to complete in this module were in the form of 'Progress checks' based on the information given to show understanding of the material. I found it hugly informative and refered to the item in this module regulary over my first and some of my second year of University.

I will post the material given to us along with the results of the progress checks (as the questions asked are not availible once the quiz was completed).
