## üí≠ Reflection

This module gave me a critical foundation in the mathematics behind game development. These topics fed directly into other areas like **AI**, **graphics programming**, **physics simulation**, and **game engine architecture** in later years.

While I found some sections more challenging (like Vectors), consistent effort and repetition helped solidify my understanding ‚Äî and the high overall grade reflects that.
